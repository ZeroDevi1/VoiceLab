# uv config for this workflow.
#
# Why this exists:
# - CosyVoice pins torch/torchaudio GPU wheels that are typically served from PyTorch's index.
# - onnxruntime-gpu can require a CUDA-specific index (see upstream comments).
#
# If your network cannot access these indexes, set them via env vars or edit this file.
