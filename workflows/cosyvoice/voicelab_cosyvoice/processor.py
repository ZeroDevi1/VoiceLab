    VoiceLab override for CosyVoice parquet opener.

    Why this exists:
    - When the number of parquet shards is smaller than DataLoader workers, CosyVoice's
      shard-level sampling can assign the same shard to multiple workers, duplicating
      samples within an epoch.
    - This opener splits rows within a shard by worker_id to avoid duplication.

    Expected sample fields (provided by CosyVoice DataList sampler):
    - src: parquet path
    - worker_id: int
    - num_workers: int
